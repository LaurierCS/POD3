## Development: UNITY 

## Description:
Eclipse Encounter is an action-packed, educational game designed to test your reflexes, knowledge, and strategic thinking. Set in the immersive environment of an eclipse, you must navigate through levels filled with enemies and challenges while answering questions to progress. Developed using Unity, Eclipse Encounter offers a unique blend of shooting mechanics, trivia quizzes, and immersive gameplay.
  
## Core Gameplay:
As the player, you face waves of enemies approaching you while armed with weapons to defend yourself. Your goal is to shoot down enemies while staying alive. Killing a certain number of enemies creates a checkpoint, and each enemy defeated adds to your timer. However, getting hit by enemies reduces your time. The game features levels that progressively introduce new mechanics, weapons, and enemy types.

## Features:
- Engaging shooting mechanics where enemies are represented by code keywords and random people asking you questions.
- Checkpoints that serve as milestones, offering hints to help you progress.
- Educational elements integrated into the gameplay, such as quizzes at the end of each level, presented by "Davey B."
- Highscore leaderboard showcasing the top scores and the last three attempts of the player.
- Timer displayed in the top left corner, reflecting your performance in terms of speed and accuracy.
- Unique setting within an eclipse, providing a visually stunning backdrop for the intense action.

## Game Flow:
Level Progression: Navigate through levels filled with enemies, learning how to use weapons effectively and understanding enemy behaviors.
